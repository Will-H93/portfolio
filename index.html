            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi I'm Will, I'm 29 and I don't go outside a lot. Would rather play games, read comics and imagine about learning how to play guitar but never actually doing it (I own the guitar though!)</p>
            <p>I've wanted to learn to code since I was a kid, with an idea to invent a real-life Pokedex! More recently I've found a career reason to do it, being able to code just opens so many opportunities and it puts some projects back in my own hands. I've finally taken that next step and enrolled with Manchester Codes on the Software Developer FastTrack.</p>
